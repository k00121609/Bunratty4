    <td>After the death of Robert de Muscegros the lands were passed onto Thomas de Clare by King Edward I, of England. De Clare built a stone castle here that was surrounded by walls. His timing was significant in terms of Irish culture as he drove all the Irish inhabitants off the island, replacing them with his own Norman Settlers.
Thus, not surprisingly, there was a great amount of conflict between de Clare and the native McNamara family of the area.
