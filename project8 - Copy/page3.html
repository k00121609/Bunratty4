                <h3>The Industrial History of the River</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>There were milling laws from Early Medieval Europe. Not even the German legal codes afforded water-mills such prominence.</li>
            <li>When Ireland came under the influence of Great Britain “soke rights” were introduced.</li> 
             <li>This legal obligation meant that tenants on an estate had use for the land-lords mill.</li>
            <li>On many occasions farmers were understandably upset when they were prevented by the land-lords “soke rights” from going to another cheaper mill.</li> 
             <li>For the diligent miller, this arrangement ensured a safe income. Sometimes, mills were exempt from tithes.</li>
             <li>Today the present site of the Mills are masked under mature underwood.</li> <li>However, references by the farmer who owns the land where the Mills are located: in 1978 stated that there are remains from the Mills including building foundations, a vertical grinding stone and a substantial settling-tank.</li>
             <li>As water transport was the main source of goods movement on the river, it became necessary to build a stone-faced quay above any possible flood level of the river.</li>  
             <li>There is also evidence of some ancient dredging along the river. Today, the quay is overgrown, though, most of its stone facing wall remains.</li> 
        
             <li><em>Such a river was clearly a centre of great activity and industry during these years. A sculpture can be seen in the Bunratty River reminiscent of the Mills and central part it had in people’s lives and the story of the Bunratty River.</em></li>
                </ul>
