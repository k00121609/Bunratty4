          <h3>Fishing on the Bunratty River</h3> 
        
            <p>Fishing on a river is an often sought out activity. The Bunratty River has been well known over time as mixed-fishing river. Today Anglers use this river to    catch: salmon, pike, roach, rudd, perch, bream, brown-trout and sea trout.</p>
            
            <p>The fishing of the Bunratty River is controlled by the No.8 or Limerick District of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA).<p>
            
            <p>There are from the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the EPA, restrictions on the fishing use of the river:
                In 2015, the Bunratty river which was open for “catch and release” was closed for that year.
                This year, 2016 the river was re-opened for “catch and release” along the river.
                This means there is permitted ‘catch and release’ of wild fish and harvesting of hatchery salmon.
                Anglers are not allowed to: use worms; single, barbless hooks and the fish must be handled carefully and not to be removed from the water before release.</p>
            
        <h3>Effects of Flood Relief Works</h3>
            <p>The physical works scheme of flood alleviation if anything has improved the fish carrying capacity of the lower Bunratty river towards Bunratty.</p>
            
            <p>It is now shallower and less shaded and this results in the increased aquatic macrophyte growth which in turn may boost coarse fish stocks.</p>
