            <p>Dolphins from the Shannon Estuary in the Bunratty River pods of Dolphins frequent the Shannon Estuary and sometimes make their way up the Bunratty River at high tide and return to the Shannon River again.</p>
        
            <p>In 2013, they made national headlines as 3 of the pod of these dolphins became stranded in low tide for 10 days. Before, it was in 1995 that this type of event occurred.</p>
            
            <p>The location was in the Bunratty River at a point which is a hive of human activity central to the Bunratty Village.  It was essential that they were helped return to the main river salt water as soon as possible. They were monitored by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG) and they returned to the Estuary unharmed.</p>
